Deprecations
````````````

Passing a ``pad`` size of ``None`` (the default) as a synonym for zero to
the ``append_axes``, ``new_horizontal`` and ``new_vertical`` methods of
`.axes_grid1.axes_divider.AxesDivider` is deprecated.  In a future release, the
default value of ``None`` will mean "use :rc:`figure.subplot.wspace` or
:rc:`figure.subplot.hspace`" (depending on the orientation).  Explicitly pass
``pad=0`` to keep the old behavior.
