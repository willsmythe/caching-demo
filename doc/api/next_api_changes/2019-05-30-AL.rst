Changes to the Matplotlib build
```````````````````````````````

Previously, it was possible to package Windows DLLs into the Maptlotlib
wheel (or sdist) by copying them into the source tree and setting the
``package_data.dlls`` entry in ``setup.cfg``.

DLLs copied in the source tree are now always packaged; the
``package_data.dlls`` entry has no effect anymore.  If you do not want to
include the DLLs, don't copy them into the source tree.
