Deprecations
````````````

Returning a factor equal to None from axisartist Locators (which are **not**
the same as "standard" tick Locators), or passing a factor equal to None
to axisartist Formatters (which are **not** the same as "standard" tick
Formatters) is deprecated.  Pass a factor equal to 1 instead.
