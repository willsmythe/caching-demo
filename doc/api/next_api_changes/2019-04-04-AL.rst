Deprecations
````````````

``mpl_toolkits.axisartist.grid_finder.GridFinderBase`` is deprecated (its
only use is to be inherited by the `GridFinder` class which just provides
more defaults in the constructor and directly sets the transforms, so
``GridFinderBase``'s methods were just moved to `GridFinder`).
