Changes in font weight guessing
```````````````````````````````

Font weight guessing now first checks for the presence of the FT_STYLE_BOLD_FLAG
before trying to match substrings in the font name.  In particular, this means
that Times New Roman Bold is now correctly detected as bold, not normal weight.
